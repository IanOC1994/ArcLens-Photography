## UX Design

Design was based on a 'Bauhaus' colour scheme and design ethos. Bauhaus is a 20th century German design school of thought that follows the principal tenant of "form follows function and less is more". This style is characterised by a purposeful lack of ornamentation and a focus on clean lines to return forms to their essential elements. The style often includes the use of geometric shapes such as squares, triangles and circles.

In my design, I have opted for a clean minimalistic style of interface which follows the bauhaus principles and colour palette. This will aid in the accsessiblity and usability of the site.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was inspired by some of the main tones found in Bauhaus design.

The aim of the colour scheme was to be light and inviting while matching in with the Bauhaus colour palatte. I opted for warm tan colours and then plain and simple black and white to make images and text stand out.

- '#d6c2af' was used as the primary background for headers, footers and navbar. It was also used as the primary colour for buttons.
- '#c7a381' was used as the secondary colour and was utilised as a border colour for buttons. I was also the background colour for hover effects on buttons. 
- '#000000' was used as the primary colour for all text.
- '#ccc'    was used as the secondary colour for text and appeared as the placeholder text in the contact form. 
- '#ffffff' was used as the primary background for the body of each page. 
- '#f4c150' was used as the colour for the star rating in testimonials.

I used the site [colorkit.io](https://colorkit.co/palette/d6c2af-c7a381-ffffff-ccc-000000-f4c150/) to create my colour palette.

### Typography

I chose [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) as my primary font in this project for its clean lines and adherence to Bauhaus design asthetics. 

As a contrast, [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was choosen for the secondary font and used in testimonials and the contact form.

Sans-serif and cursive were used as fallback fonts. 

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used for all social media links in the burger menu and header. 

[favicon generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) was used to create a tab icon.

## Features

### Existing Features

**Header & Navigation**

- Header with logo and navigation page allows for easy access to all available pages. I also made the choice to include the social media icons in the header beneath the nav bar for both style and functionality. My reasoning: people do not always scroll to the botton of the page.

- It is responsive depending on screen size. When it drops down beyond 1024px, all nav items and social media links are place in a burger menu.

 **Portfolio Navigation** 

 - The choice was made to include the portfolio navigation on both the home and portfolio pages. This design choice was made to improve user interaction. Users have the facility to access the websites portfolio on the home page without to many clicks. The navigation is fully adaptable for all screen sizes and goes from fixed text to appearing text on larger screens when the mouse is hovered over it.

 **Contact Us Button**

 - This feature is included on every page outside of the contact page to give users the opportunity to access the contact form from anywhere on the website. This improves the user experience as it makes the website extremely accessible and encourages potential clients to reach out which is the overarching aim of the website as a whole.

**Contact Us Form**

- The contact form allows users to reach out and request a quotation or call back as well as any other queries. The form requires all field to be filled to successfully send.

**Contact Us Success Message**

- This message triggers once the send button has been triggered on the contact form. This provides the user with some feedback that thier query has been sent to the recipient successfully.

**Favicon in Page Tab**

- The camera lens diapraghm makes the tab easily identifiable as a photography related website and therefore easier for the user to find.

**Footer**

- The footer is purposefully plain in this specific project as a personal choice of the designer. I often find users do not scroll to the bottom of the page and therefore the footer contents can often be lost.

### Future Features

**About Section**

- Moving forward with this project, I would like to add functionality to the about section in order to provide a place for the user to learn more about the company and the people that work there. 

**News Section**

- The addition of a news section would allow users to stay up to date with company activities and projects in the form of regular news bulletins.
